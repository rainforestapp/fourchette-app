  <b>Your new best friend for isolated testing environments on Heroku</b>
 </p>

## IMPORTANT
This is a generated Fourchette app for ease of deploy. Fourchette itself lives in another repo: https://github.com/rainforestapp/fourchette.

## What is Fourchette?

Fourchette is your new best friend for having isolated testing environments. It will help you test your [@GitHub](https://github.com/github) PRs against a fork of one your [@Heroku](https://github.com/heroku) apps. You will have one Heroku app per PR now. Isn't that amazing? It will make testing way easier and you won't have the (maybe) broken code from other PRs on staging but only the code that requires testing.

Fourchette is maintained by [@jipiboily](https://github.com/jipiboily/)! You can see the other [contributors here](https://github.com/rainforestapp/fourchette/graphs/contributors).
